# Hello!!
### You can call me Laonye, I'm a Brazilian computer science student. <br>
I'm still on the process to join a university, and for the moment my goals are around to learn the most about software development and practice my coding skills.<br>
For the moment I'm focusing on learning Java, Rust and HTML/CSS with some JavaScript.<br>
I'm also planning on making projects to help the Brazilian community, such as ways to improve the study of software and mathematics.<br>
I'm extremely interested in open and free software, and specially Linux related.<br>
I use Arch, btw.
