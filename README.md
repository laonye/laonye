# Hello!!
### You can call me Laonye, I'm a Brazilian computer science student. <br>
I'm still on the process to join a university, and for the moment my goals are around to learn the most about software development and practice my coding skills. For the moment I'm focusing on learning Java, Rust and a bit of Front-End.<br>
I'm extremely interested in open and free software, specially Linux related. I use Arch, btw.
<br>
<br>
Also, I have a goal this year to make a coding streak as long as I can. The first goal is one year.
