# Hello!!
### You can call me Laonye, I'm a Brazilian computer science student. <br>
I'm still on the process to join a university, and for the moment my goals are around to learn the most about software development and practice my coding skills. I'm focusing on learning Java, Rust and a bit of Front-End.<br>
I'm extremely interested in open and free software, specially Linux related. I use Arch, btw.
